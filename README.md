# Physics Waves and Optics

## Overview
This project simulates damped harmonic motion using numerical methods. The simulation calculates the displacement, kinetic energy, and potential energy of a damped harmonic oscillator over time. The results are visualized using matplotlib, allowing for a clear understanding of the dynamics involved in damped harmonic motion.

## Files
- **Damped-Harmonic-Motion.py**: This script performs the simulation and generates plots for displacement, kinetic energy, and potential energy.

## Instructions for Running the Script
1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Install the required dependencies by running:
   ```
   pip install matplotlib
   ```
3. Run the simulation script:
   ```
   python Damped-Harmonic-Motion.py
   ```

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- matplotlib
