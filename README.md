# Physics Waves and Optics

## Overview
This project contains various simulations related to physics, specifically focusing on waves and optics. The simulations include damped harmonic motion, simple harmonic motion, and the motion of a car showing velocity, speed, and acceleration over time. The results are visualized using matplotlib, allowing for a clear understanding of the dynamics involved in each scenario.

## Files
- **Damped-Harmonic-Motion.py**: This script performs the simulation of a damped harmonic oscillator and generates plots for displacement, kinetic energy, and potential energy.
- **Simple-Harmonic-Motion.py**: This script performs the simulation of a simple harmonic oscillator and generates plots for displacement, kinetic energy, and potential energy.
- **Velocity-and-Acceleration.py**: This script simulates the motion of a car, showing the velocity, speed, and acceleration over time.
